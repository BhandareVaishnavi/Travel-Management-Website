      "We reached Kochi in the morning and were welcomed by the rejuvenating freshness of the tea gardens. Our train got delayed and our phones were out of reach for a few hours, yet when we reached Cochin, we saw the driver patiently waiting for us. And as soon as our phone regained signal strength our agent Anoop also gave us a call to ensure our driver was there to escort us to our hotel. I prefer taking my own vehicle on my journeys. I love driving but as it was a little expensive, Anoop suggested that booking a cab would turn out to be cheaper and more comfortable than traveling in our own car. We had a driver and cab with us throughout our journey. The driver was a photographer, which was an added advantage. We checked into our Hotel, Las Palmas in Devipullar. It was a great hotel, very comfortable and beautiful. We then went to Dreamland, which was a great experience. It gave us just what we were looking for, natural beauty at its best! Dreamland was followed by a visit to the Ayurvedic massage center. The entire experience was blissful, everyone traveling to Kerala must give it a visit. We then came back to the hotel, enjoyed a bonfire, ate the amazing food that was served at the hotel and called it a day!",

      "After breakfast, we went to the waterfall and the tea plantations. The tea plantations were just beautiful. Post that it was time for the Jeep Safari. We went through the jungle and had a close encounter with the wild animals. This was thoroughly enjoyed by my son who has a keen interest in wild animals. We also went for an elephant ride that cost us INR 400 per person and INR 300 extra for getting our images clicked. So,in total we paid INR 1500. It was a memorable experience for my child, hence I didn’t mind paying a little extra. We then returned to the hotel, ate dinner (food is great at Las Palmas) and retired for the day.",
